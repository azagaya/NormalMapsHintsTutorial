# Normal Maps Hints

## Introduction

*Normal maps* are textures used to increase the detail of dynamic lighting on surface. With them, you
can make a flat surface look like a complex geometry, with relief and texture, when interacting with
lights.

In this tutorial you will learn some common use cases of *normal maps* in Godot engine for 2D games,
and I will tell you some considerations you should know to make the most of this powerful technique.

## General Concepts

A *normal map* is a 2D texture in which each pixel color represents a *normal vector*. A *normal
vector* is a unit vector perpendicular to a surface. So when using a *normal map* on a surface,
you are actually passing to the engine information about the geometry you would like that surface
to have, and so the engine can make the calculations for dynamic lighting.

A deeper explanation about *normal maps* is out of the scope of this tutorial, but you can refer
to this sites if you want to learn more about them:

## Sprite with *normal map* in godot

For this section, we will be using this sprite and *normal map*:

![Sample Sprite](img/sample.png)
![Sample Normal Map](img/sample_n.png)

Godot engine makes it really easy to use *normal maps* in 2D games. For this first example, open
Godot engine, create a new scene, and add a `Sprite` node to it. `Sprite` nodes have a "Normal Map"
property that can be set in the *Inspector* dock. You just need to drag an image from the *File 
System* dock, and drop it in the "Normal Map" property of the `Sprite`.

![Adding Normal Map to Sprite](img/adding-normal-map.gif)

You won't be noticing anything, since normal maps only work with lights. So, go ahead and add a 
`Light2D` node. Set a texture to it, and remember to increase the *Height* property under the 
*Range* group in the inspector. If we assume all sprites are placed in a plance, the light's
height is how far the light is placed from that plane, in the *Z* axis, and you need to increase it
to make the lighting effect more noticeable.

You should be able to notice now some dynamic lightng, that makes the sprite look like it has relief
or depth. But the scene overall may be to bright and the effect is not as we would expect in
more realistic lighting. For a better result, add a `Canvas Modulate` node to the scene, and set
its *Color* property in the inspector to dark gray. Now the effect should look a lot better. 
`Canvas Modulate` node let us, in this case, simulate *amient light*.

## Seamless texture with *normal map*

For this section, we will be using this texture and *normal map*:

![Bricks](img/simplebrick.png)
![Bricks Normal Map](img/simplebrick_n.png)

Assume you have a seamless texture, that you want to use as background for your game. For this
purpose, you would enable *Repeate* and reimport the texture. The only thing you should note when
using normal maps with such texture, is to also enable *Repeate* on the normal map, and reimport it.

Create a new scene, and add to it the same nodes that in the previous example (`Sprite`, `Light2D`,
and `CanvasModulate`). Then, drag the texture and normal map to the corresponding properties of the
`Sprite` node. Also, enable *Region* property in the `Sprite`, and set the *Rect* to something 
bigger than the original texture. As both the normal map and the texture are seamless, you should end up with something like this:

![Seamless example](img/seamless.gif)

Although this example may feel trivial after the first one, it lets us arrive to the conclusion that
may not be obvious for someone not used to how things are rendered. This is, the engine will use the
same coordinates for the texture and normal map. This will become relevant in the next few examples.

## Animations with Normal Maps

In this example, you will learn some tips about using normal maps with animations. Cutout animations
will not be covered, as it is just a matter of adding a normal map to each sprite. We will be using
this images:

![Robot spritesheet](img/spritesheet.png)
![Robot spritesheet normal map](img/spritesheet_n.png)

There are two simple ways to create animations from a spritesheet in Godot engine. The first is
settings each frame in an `AnimationPlayer` node, and the second, using an `AnimatedSprite`.

### Normal Maps with AnimationPlayer

Once again, create a new scene, with a `Sprite`, `Light2D`, and `CanvasModulate` nodes. Add the
spritesheet and its normal map to the corresponding properties of the `Sprite` node, and set the
*Hframes* property, in the *Animation* group in the *Inspector*, to `11` (the number of frames
our spritesheet has). Then, add an `AnimationPlayer` node, create a new animation called "Idle",
with a duration of `0.8` seconds, loop enabled, and all the eleven frames. And that's all! As we
colncluded in the previous example, the engine will use the same coordinates for the texture and
the normal map, which meanse the corresponding section of the normal map will be used in each frame.
You should see something like this:

![AnimationPlayer with Normal Map](img/animationplayer-normal.gif)

### Normal Maps with AnimatedSprite

Perhaps your animation is too simple to justify the use of an `AnimationPlayer`, and you would
prefer to use an `AnimatedSprite` instead. But that node doesn't have a "Normal Map" property!
However, with a really simple shader we can use normal maps with `AnimatedSprite`.

Add an `AnimatedSprite` node to the previous scene, and, in the *Inspector*, add a new 
*SpriteFrames* in the *Frames* properties. Now you can create a new animation, and click on the 
"Add frames from Spritesheet" button in the animation editor. In the popup file dialog, select the
spritesheet, and then set *Horizontal* and *Vertical* settings to `11` and `1` respectively. 
Finally, choose all eleven frames, and you should see the idle animation playing on your 
`AnimatedSprite`. For a better result, set the *FPS* setting in the animation editor to `12`.

You can take a moment now, and compare how different the animation with and without normal map
looks. Note how the animation with normal map looks as if the sprite had volume.

![Comparation with and without normal map](img/comparation.gif)

Lets add a normal map. For this, got to the *Material* property of the`AnimatedSprite` node in the 
inspector and create a new *Shader Material*. Create a new *Shader* in the corresponding property
of the material, and add this code to it:

```glsl
shader_type canvas_item;

uniform sampler2D normal_map;

void fragment(){
	NORMAL = 2.0*texture(normal_map, UV).rgb - 1.0;
    
}
```

The `normal_map` uniform defined in this shader will let you drag the normal map to the 
corresponding property under the *Shader Param* group in the inspector. In the `fragment()` 
function, we are sampling the normal map texture, transforming each sampled value to a valid unit
vector, and assigning that unit vector to the `NORMAL` built-in attribute. After setting the normal
map in the inspector to the uniform, you should end up with an animation being lit just like the
previous example.

### Normal Maps with Skeleton Deform

For this example, we are going to use the same sprite and normal map from the first example.
If you are not familiar with 2D Skeleton Deform, you should refer to 
[this](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/animation/2d_skeletons.html)
tutorial from Godot's official documentation, before going on, as explaining that thecnique is
out of the scope of this tutorial.

Create a new scene, and this time add a `Polygon2D` node, instead of a `Sprite`. Set the texture
from the first example to it. Also, add an `Skeleton2D` with a `Bone2D` child, and an 
`AnimationPlayer` to create the animation. Also, as always, add a `Light2D` and a 
`CanvasModulate` node. Your scene should look like this:

![Mesh Deform Scene Tree](img/mesh-scene-tree.png)

After that, create an animation like the following one, with the concepts shown in the tutorial linked
above.

![Skeleton Animation](img/skeleton-animation.gif)

You surely noticed that `Polygon2D` does not have a *Normal Map* attribute in the *Inspector* dock.
The the approach in this use case is similar than when using an *AnimatedSprite*. Add a material to
the `Polygon2D`, with the shader shown in the [Normal Maps with AnimatedSprite](#normal-maps-with-animatedsprite)
example.

You should see this a final result:

![Skeleton deform with normal map](img/skeleton-with-normal.gif)

## Normal maps in TileMaps

Once you have added *normal maps* to every sprite in your game, you would probably want to also
want your *Tile Maps* react in a similar way to lighting. 

For this example, we will be using this tile set and normal map:

![Sample Sprite](img/tile.png)
![Sample Normal Map](img/tile_n.png)

Create a new scene, and this time add a `TileMap`, a `Light2D` and a `CanvasModulate` node.
Select the `TileMap` in the *Scene Tree*, and in the *Inspector* create a new *TileSet*. The
*TileSet* editor should open, and you can drag and drop there the tileset image. Go ahead and
create individual tiles from it. If you are not familiar with this, refer to 
[Using tilemaps](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/2d/using_tilemaps.html) page
in Godot's documentation.

Once you create a tile, you should see in the *Inspector* a group called *Selected Tile*, and 
you can drag and drop the *normal map* in the corresponding property there. But have in mind
that you should set the full *normal map* (i.e the *normal map* of the whole tileset) to each 
single tiles. So you will end up adding the same *normal map* multiple times, once for each
tile. Remember that we concluded that the engine uses the same coordinates for the texture
and normal map. This means that if a single tile is using a region of the full tileset, the
engine will use the same region of the *normal map*. A common mistake here is to set the
*normal map* of the single tile.

If you did it right, you should see something like this:

![TileMap with Normal Map](img/tilemap-with-normals.gif)

If you are using autotile, you will just need to set the normal map once per autotile created.
If all your tiles are in sepparate files, then you should also have normals for each tile 
sepparated.

## Conclusions

If you commpleted this mini-tutorial, now you should be able to use *normal maps* and 

dynamic lighting in your 2D games for several use cases!
